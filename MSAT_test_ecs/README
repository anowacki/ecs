= About =

The files in this directory were produced using the Voigt expressions
for average velocity given the Love parameters for radial anisotropy.
A short code in Fortran 90 was used to convert from parameters into
elasticity.


= File format =

The files contain 21 elastic constants and density on one line like this:
    c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 c22 c23 c24 c25 c26 c33 c34 c35 c36 c44 c45 c46 c55 56 c66 rho
where cij are in Pa, and rho is in kg/m^3 (SI units).

Files are named with the parameters like this:
    vp[vp]_vs[vs]_rho[rho]_xi[xi]_phi[phi]_eta[eta].ecs
where [x] is the value of x.


= Symmetry =

The files have rotational symmetry about x3.
